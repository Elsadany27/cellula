- Auth file : that used to sign up or login in the app that divided to two files ==>
Sign up file : used to create new account
login : used to login in the app if user have account

- To organized files , I used clean arch:
  Data layer :
  used repoimpl to implement signup & login functions,
  Domain Layer:
  used repo to declare signup & login functions (prototypes)
  Presentation Layer:
  used to create UI for the app & create custom widgets
